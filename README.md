# Images
This is a google chrome extension that add positive messages from the meetings of the UCKG Helpcentre.

This extension was made by me and it is not officially supported by the UCKG. It's just my hobby work.

# Install 

git clone https://github.com/mauricioph/Images.git

Open goggle chrome and type in the address bar
[code]
chrome://extensions/
[/code]
On this page click on developer mode / load packed extension. Upload the crx file in the repository.
Every time you open a new tab a message will show.

If you want to spin it off and create your own follow this:

When you are going to load the extension selec unpacked extension. Upload a zip file of this repository folder. Bear in mind that the manifesto.js has to be in the root folder of the pack. Meaning you need to pack inside the Images folder.
